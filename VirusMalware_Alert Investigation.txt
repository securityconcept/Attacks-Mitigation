AV related Alert. Suppose AV has detected some malicious files and in SIEM we have found that AV quarantine the file.

Step-by-Step Guide to Investigating AV Alerts in SIEM

1. Receive and Acknowledge Alert

Acknowledge the alert and collect initial information about the alert like "Threat name or signature", "File path and name", "Hash values (MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256)", "Actions taken by the AV (e.g., quarantine, deletion)".

2-Start Analysis on SIEM :

Compare collected hash values with known malware hash databases to identify malicious files.(Virus Total, IBM X-Force)

Correlate hash and filename information with other systems and network activity to identify potential threats.

if we have a sandbox environment, we can run that file in the sandbox and analyze its behavior.

Also, do a historical search for that hash value and malicious filename.

Also, we can check any outbound traffic from the internal IP which we have found in the alert.

Also, we can check connection logs from the username we found in the alert. To check if that user accesses any resource within the network. For this, we can check AD logs because logging and logout events we can get from AD logs.

Also, check for any unusual user activities like accessing sensitive files and other resources.

3-Now contact to IT team to isolate the user's machine from the network and put the system for forensics.

4-Also raise a concern to the AV team for proper system scanning and remove all malware traces and suspicious processes.

5-At the same time central IT team checks for any malicious Windows processes, and new process and also check the registries. Are there any changes happening in registries?

6-Once all the steps are performed and also confirmation is received from the AV team now send a mail to all stakeholders.
