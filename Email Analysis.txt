Step by Step analysis of a Potential Malicious Email: 

Step 1: Initial Email Body Review:

a-Read the Email Carefully:

The first step in assessing an email for potential threats is to carefully read its content. This involves understanding the context, purpose, 
and requests made within the email.

Check for any urgent or threatening language: 

Phishing emails often use urgent language to prompt immediate action. Phrases like "immediate action required," 
"your account will be locked," or "last chance to secure your account" are common. These phrases are designed to create a sense of panic, pushing the 
recipient to act quickly without thinking critically.

Threats: 

Be wary of any language that implies negative consequences if no action is taken. This could include threats of legal action, fines, 
or account suspension. The aim is to intimidate the recipient into compliance.

Look for requests for sensitive information or actions:

Legitimate organizations rarely ask for sensitive information such as passwords, social security numbers, or bank details via email. 
If an email requests such information, it is a red flag.
============================================================================================================

Step2-Identify Links and Attachments:

The second step involves identifying any hyperlinks or attachments within the email, which are common vectors for malware or phishing attempts.

Step2- Save and Examine the email: 

a-Save the email in .eml or .msg format for detailed analysis. Saving the email in these format preserves the original email structure, making it easier to analyse

for phishing attempts, malicious content and other threats.

For example you can upload this save email(.eml or .msg) in tools like phishtool which will give you full analysis.

b-Open the email header: Use an email client or web-based service to view the email header information.

Examine the email header provides insights into the technical details of the email such as the sender's IP address, the email's path

through the internet and any modification made during transit. This information is crucial for identifying spoofed or malicious emails.

Email client like Gmail, outlook, thunderbird. Use these email clients and open the mail and view the header information.

web based services are available for examining email header such as "MXToolbox" or Google'e email header analyzer.

============================================================================================================

Step3-Analyze the Email Header:

The first step is to obtain the complete email header, which contains vital information about the email’s journey and origins and pasted it into email header
analyzer tool like MXTool.

While doing header analysis, check below key fields:

1-Received: Indicates the sequence of mail servers that handled the email.

How to analyze:

Trace the email’s path from bottom to top.

Ensure that each server listed in the sequence is legitimate and expected.

Look for unusual or unauthorized servers and check the chronological order of timestamps for consistency.

Example:

Received: from mail.example.com (mail.example.com [192.168.1.1])
        by mail.recipient.com with SMTP;
        Tue, 1 Jan 2024 12:34:56 -0500


2-From and Reply-To: Indicates the sender’s email address and the reply-to address.

How to Analyze:

Ensure the From field is from a legitimate source and matches the sender’s domain.

Verify that the Reply-To field, if present, matches the From address or is from an expected domain.

Example:

From: sender@example.com
Reply-To: sender@example.com


3-Message-ID: Provides a unique identifier for the email, often reflecting the sender’s domain.

How to Analyze:

Check if the Message-ID follows the expected format for the sender’s domain.

Look for any unusual or non-standard formats that might indicate spoofing.

Example:

Message-ID: <unique-id@example.com>

4-SPF,DKIM,DMARC: These are email authentication mechanisms that help verify the sender’s legitimacy.

How to Analyze:

SPF (Sender Policy Framework): Ensure the email passed the SPF check, indicating it came from an authorized server.

DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail): Verify the DKIM signature, which ensures the email’s content has not been altered.

DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance): Check the DMARC result to see if the email passed both SPF and DKIM checks.

Example:

Authentication-Results: dmarc=pass (p=NONE sp=NONE dis=NONE) 
         smtp.mailfrom=example.com; 
         dkim=pass header.i=@example.com; 
         spf=pass (sender IP is 192.168.1.1) 
         smtp.mailfrom=example.com;

==============================================================================================================

Step4-Verify Sender Authenticity : Verifying the sender’s authenticity ensures that the email is from a legitimate source and helps prevent phishing 
and spoofing attacks.

1. SPF Record Lookup : SPF (Sender Policy Framework) records specify which mail servers are permitted to send emails on behalf of a domain. 
Verifying the SPF record helps confirm that the email was sent from an authorized server.

How to Perform an SPF Record Lookup:

Go to MXToolbox SPF Check:

Open your web browser and navigate to the MXToolbox SPF Check.

Enter the sender’s domain:

In the provided text box, enter the domain of the sender (e.g., example.com).

Click "SPF Record Lookup":

Click the button to perform the lookup.

Review the results:

The tool will display the SPF record for the domain. Ensure that the sending IP address is listed as an authorized server for the domain.


2-DKIM Record Lookup: DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) uses a cryptographic signature to verify that an email’s content has not been altered during transit. 
Checking the DKIM signature ensures the integrity and authenticity of the email.

How to Perform a DKIM Record Lookup:

Go to MXToolbox DKIM Check:

Open your web browser and navigate to the MXToolbox DKIM Check.

Enter the DKIM selector and domain:

In the provided text boxes, enter the DKIM selector (found in the email header) and the sender’s domain (e.g., example.com).

Click "DKIM Lookup":

Click the button to perform the lookup.

Review the results:

The tool will display the DKIM record for the domain. Ensure that the DKIM signature in the email matches the record and validates correctly.


3-DMARC Record Lookup: DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance) builds on SPF and DKIM by adding a layer of policy enforcement 
and reporting. Verifying the DMARC policy helps ensure that the email complies with the domain’s specified authentication requirements.

How to Perform a DMARC Record Lookup:

Go to MXToolbox DMARC Check:

Open your web browser and navigate to the MXToolbox DMARC Check.

Enter the sender’s domain:

In the provided text box, enter the domain of the sender (e.g., example.com).

Click "DMARC Lookup":

Click the button to perform the lookup.

Review the results:

The tool will display the DMARC record for the domain. Ensure that the policy is set up correctly and that the email complies with the domain’s DMARC policy.
